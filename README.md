For this project we took a huge bike rental data set and using Tableau created several graphis and visuals with breakdowns of the data. 

The framework for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. While Des Moines is a long way away from the hustle and bustle of NYC, this analysis might help answer a few key questions:

Who uses bikeshare programs?
What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
How much are the bikes used and by whom?
